-------------------------------
Installation of Atom and Sphinx
-------------------------------

This document describes the way of installing to needed tools to create workshop content in the sphinx format called ReStructredText (RST). Using this method it is possible to have the content “separated” from type of document. In the first place we will use the rst file as a source and have a sphinx compiler on the internet to create the HTML pages that we show in the workshops.

.. note:: To have Atom integrate with GitHub, make sure you have an account there.

The installation process overview
---------------------------------

To get to the right level of tooling to create the workshops and push them onto GitHub the following steps will be taken:

#. Prerequirements

#. Download of Atom (this is an example tool for creating .rst files. Reason for using this product is that it is a) free and b) available on most platforms (Mac, Windows and Linux)). There are other editor tools avail as well, but for the ease of use we have chosen this product.

#. Installation of Atom

#. Configuration of Atom

#. (Optional) Installation of Sphinx. Optional is Sphinx installation and configuration. Having Sphinx installed on your machine makes it possible to generate the HTML pages based on your local content offline to see if everything looks as you intended it to be.

#. Integration with GitHub

#. Getting the needed templates from GitHub

#. Create a document using the templates

#. Save the created document and run commits and push towards personal GitHub

#. Pull the created document towards the Organisational GitHub
